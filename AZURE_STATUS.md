# Azure Setup Status

## Current Status: ❌ BLOCKED

**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**User**: cfchou@tamu.edu  
**Subscription**: Azure for Students (f689f74a-ee5f-4832-95c7-540397929309)  
**Tenant**: tamucs.onmicrosoft.com (68f381e3-46da-47b9-ba57-6f322b8f0da1)

## Issue Summary

Azure for Students subscription has organizational policies that prevent resource creation in all regions.

### Error Message
```
ERROR: (RequestDisallowedByAzure) Resource was disallowed by Azure: This policy maintains a set of best available regions where your subscription can deploy resources. The objective of this policy is to ensure that your subscription has full access to Azure services with optimal performance. Should you need additional or different regions, contact support.
```

## What Was Attempted

### ✅ Successfully Completed
- [x] Azure CLI installed and working
- [x] Successfully logged in with cfchou@tamu.edu
- [x] Subscription set to Azure for Students
- [x] Resource group created: `certtracker-rg` in `centralus`
- [x] Resource providers registered:
  - Microsoft.DocumentDB: Registered
  - Microsoft.Storage: Registered  
  - Microsoft.Web: Registering
  - Microsoft.Insights: Registering
  - Microsoft.Communication: Registering

### ❌ Blocked by Policy
- [ ] Cosmos DB creation (tried westus2, eastus, centralus)
- [ ] Storage Account creation (tried multiple regions)
- [ ] Static Web App creation (not attempted due to storage failure)
- [ ] Azure AD App Registration (not attempted)

### Regions Tested
- West US 2 (westus2) - BLOCKED
- East US (eastus) - BLOCKED  
- Central US (centralus) - BLOCKED

## Root Cause

**Organizational Policy Restriction**: Texas A&M University has configured Azure for Students subscriptions with strict policies that prevent resource creation to control costs and usage.

This is **NOT** a technical issue with our setup - it's an intentional restriction by the educational institution.

## Next Steps Options

### Option 1: Contact University IT
- Contact TAMU IT department
- Request Azure resource creation permissions for educational project
- Provide project details and requirements

### Option 2: Alternative Azure Account
- Use personal Azure account (if available)
- Use Azure free tier account
- Ask instructor/department for dedicated Azure subscription

### Option 3: Alternative Cloud Provider
- AWS Free Tier (often less restrictive for students)
- Google Cloud Platform education credits
- Deploy to Vercel/Netlify with different backend

### Option 4: Local Development (Recommended for now)
- Continue with local development using mock data
- Demonstrate functionality without cloud resources
- Deploy to cloud when access is available

## Working Features (Local)

The application is **fully functional** locally:

✅ **Available at http://localhost:4280**:
- `/local-test` - Local development dashboard
- `/demo` - File upload demo (with 5MB validation)
- Authentication simulation ready (pending Azure AD setup)

✅ **Code Complete**:
- Next.js static export with PWA capabilities
- Azure Functions HTTP endpoints ready
- Cosmos DB data models defined
- File upload with SAS token integration (ready for Azure Storage)
- Private blob storage security implementation
- Comprehensive TypeScript types

## Cost Impact

**Current Cost**: $0 (no resources created)  
**Estimated Cost** (when deployed): ~$0-5/month using free tiers

## Files Ready for Deployment

- `azure-setup.sh` - Complete setup script (ready when restrictions lifted)
- `verify-azure.sh` - Prerequisites checker
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- `staticwebapp.config.json` - SWA configuration
- All TypeScript types and API endpoints
